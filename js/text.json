"about":"My adventure with programming began at the age of 13, when I wrote simple scripts to perform tasks in browser games for me using the Autoit language. Then I got involved in making 2d games. At the age of 14, I managed to make a survival game in which I played with my friends. The mathematical mind allowed me to come up with my own solutions. Since then, learning programming has been easy for me. It gives me great pleasure to be involved in a programming project. My passion led me to England where I decided to start my studies. The English emphasis on practical tasks instead of overly learning theories abounded in further skills. Therefore, today I am a versatile programmer who is not afraid of any programming language or technology. I am interested in many things, some of them are listed below."
